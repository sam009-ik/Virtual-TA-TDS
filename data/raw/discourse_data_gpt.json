      "Firstly I would recommend learning about promptfoo. We will be covering this topic in detail in our sessions as its important to Project evaluation and will help you evaluate your Project performance in the same manner we would. The promptfoo yaml file we provided are basically public test cases. But that is no guarantee that your project will pass all our private test cases.\nIf you read the promptfoo yaml file that we provided for testing, you will notice that it uses\nllm-rubric\nas one of the graders. By default,\nllm-rubric\nuses\ngpt-4.1-2025-04-14\n(\nPlease refer to the documentation\n)\nTherefore you would have to override the grader settings to use a different grader. Please follow the instructions in the documentation to change it to your preference.\npromptfoo.dev\nLLM Rubric | promptfoo\nllm-rubric is promptfoo's general-purpose grader for \"LLM as a judge\" evaluation.\nPlease note that we will be using OpenAI as one of our graders so you might want to run the final test using AIPipe and configuring the grader to use AIPipe (w/ the key we provided) to get a realistic idea of how your score might look when using an llm grader. That being said its fairly safe to use Ollama as there will always be some variations in the grading quality. This is expected, just as there may variations in human grading. We have mentioned this on the first page of TDS as sometimes certain evaluations are going to have some level of subjectiveness associated with it, although we have also some robust objective criteria to minimise these variations.\nTo configure providers:\npromptfoo.dev\nLLM Providers | promptfoo\nProviders in promptfoo are the interfaces to various language models and AI services. This guide will help you understand how to configure and use providers in your promptfoo evaluations.",

      "Can some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?",
      "From the graded assignment we can’t understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.",
      "Apart from what\n@CKPIITM\nobserved about this course, here’s my first impression of this course…Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway…\nThe week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective.  It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard.  The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point.  What’s the context and the motivation?  Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text.  Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.  Neither does give me much understanding anyway.  It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up.  The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\nSummary.  I feel the course is offered too early.  Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about.  At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program.  I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.\nSorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one.  I just had to.  I’m willing to hear different opinions.\nI’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.",
      "I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.\nHopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.",
      "I feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don’t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.\nBut I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.",
      "As of now, I’m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week.  Will continue after all other ML courses are done…",
      "Some sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts.\nIn the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.",
      "Adding to the discussion here, I’d also have to say it’s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it’s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.",
      "Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.\nThe other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.",
      "I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.",
      "As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don’t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.",

      "Hey guys, thank you everyone for voicing out your opinions and perspective in a healthy manner. I really appreciate it. I understand it might start to sound like greek and latin for some of you, but we intentionally made the decision to have ML foundations as co-requisite. Because you can learn the theory and try to visit back and connect with the practice (tools) part. Some pointers which could be helpful for all of you having different perspectives (both positive and negative) -\nWhat is the benefit of this course? - passing this course would definitely make you industry ready. And Anand S, who himself is a very accomplished Data Scientist wanted to give the real flavour of how you would be working in Industry (no spoon-feeding, but giving you directions). Most examinations will be open book, open internet or take home.\nWe will share all the resources (codes, excel, etc.). You can download those supplementary materials from the drive link in course contents page.\nThere will be youtube live sessions every week and the calendar will be shared soon. Please used these live sessions if you need more help or guidance.\nAll the instructors in this course are well accomplished data scientists working in industry and most of them also teach in different IITs/IIMs as faculty. So my humble request is to give them all a bit of respect as some of you are bluntly rude.\nDefinitely this course will be different from other courses because this is going to be an applied course and the idea is to make you know the different quantum of things we could do in data science. I do not think you would be Industry ready unless you get comfortable with this course honestly. Because this is the reality, this is how things are going to be once you interview for or get onboarded as DS.\nThe materials and case studies are so meticulously curated just for the purpose this course in the past 8 months. They are so valuable and try to explore use the help of live sessions to get your issues sorted out.\nUse the Youtube live sessions to the fullest those whoever need more help with this course. We would be more than happy to help. Let’s respect each other and that’s a fair expectation I guess. Thanks!",
      "Good evening\n@maheshbalan\nPoints 2 and 3 in your message will be useful and I look forward to these.\nI have separately raised another query that some of the tools being used are Gramener products.  Would you kindly assist in letting us know how we can get access to the products so that we can start playing around with them?\nregards",
      "Thank you for raising this, we will talk to the course faculty and request for access. Thanks",
      "Well, here’s an admission…I stand corrected on my opinion about the TDS course.\nwith each day watching and learning from the course, I’m absolutely excited to see the content!  It’s presented so well, so well, that I can vouch that I’ve never seen anything like this before…\nI was totally wrong and wanted to let everyone here know how perspectives can change in a matter of just 2 weeks.\nHaving said all this, I still believe the first video in this course was misplaced, and that was perhaps a very bad decision by the editors…not the course team.  If my blunt comments hurt anyone, which I’m sure it did, I apologize\n@maheshbalan",
      "Hi Anand, thank you for your positive feedback. We have to admit that some of the concerns raised by the students here helped us restructure things efficiently. Thanks for letting us know and please continue to raise concerns if you have any going forward, It will help us fine tune this course further.\nThanks,\nMahesh",
      "As things will get structured, and the motive gets  clearer to participant of this course, opinion will change, The video introduction was indeed exciting, but we as participant, who also want to score in assignment and all try to map content with ability to solve the questions and then internally rate as sufficient or insufficient, it is not about how exciting it was rather how helpful it was to score better. We don’t know how industry will judge at first, with marks, excitement, ability to learn new things and many other parameters, so when we watch video we expect it to moving around questions being asked.\nIt is like we\noverfit ourselves to video content\n, but\nunderfit the assignment content\n. So some\nregularisations\n, you as a team have to add to make it just\nright fit\n.\nWhether it’s\n@Anand\nor people like me, who themselves are teachers for more than a decade, can see the gap more profound than others and are vocal at the same time.\nTrust us we are the one who reverses our opinions if things are started to get fine tuned without any hesitation or apprehension.\nAnd surely, we are not doubting the intent of IITM, they are for sure imparting best of knowledge to mere mortals like us. We are just fortunate in many ways and thankful to IITM.\nTake our responses just as feedback. And make this course truly world class.",

      "I Kindly need Help with LLM CLI Tool –  Model Authentication Issue with Models other OpenAI models.\nI’ve been trying to go a bit deeper into Module 1 after completing GA1, and I’ve encountered some issues while experimenting with the\nllm\nCLI tool and different models.\nSpecifically, I tried running the following command to test the Gemini model, as shown on the Module 3 introduction page:\nllm\n'What is 2 + 2?'\n-m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\nBut I received the following error:\nError\n:\nError\ncode\n:\n401\n- {\n'error'\n: {\n'message'\n:\n'No auth credentials found'\n,\n'code'\n:\n401\n}}\nInitially, I had set my OpenAI key from AIPipe , but I got a “model not found” error. So I checked the available models using:\nllm model list\nAt that point, the Gemini model wasn’t listed.\nI then installed the\nllm-openrouter\nplugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I’m now facing the above authentication error.\nTo test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn’t need any credits to be purchased)\nllm\n'What is 2 + 2?'\n-m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free\nThis worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine.\nI’m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the\nllm\nCLI. I’ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven’t been able to resolve this.\nCertainly! Here’s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end:\nI also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin\nllm-openrouter\n), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the\nllm\ndocumentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this:\nexport\nOPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm\n'What is 2 + 2?'\n-m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\nHowever, even this approach didn’t work for me.\nCould you kindly guide me on how to resolve this issue?\nThank you for your time and help.\nSincerely,\nMeikanda Sivam"

Most of them involve using FastAPI, which I’ve been running locally on\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/\n. However, I’ve been facing some issues with the platform while submitting the answers.\nSpecifically, for questions involving Google Authentication and Vercel, the system initially told me the answers were correct, but when I revisited them later, I received errors like “session expired” or similar messages. This happened with Questions 12, 11, 10, and 6. Since these questions often required different local sessions or saving work separately, I ended up losing progress or getting lower marks despite having completed them.\nFrom my side, I’ve solved every question. The issue seems to be related to how the platform handles sessions and saves progress across different parts of the assignment. Could you please advise me on how to proceed or if there’s a way to ensure my work is properly counted?\nThank you for your help!\nBest regards,\nKratika Jain",
      "Hi Kratika,\nThe way to deal with questions that require the server or service to be live while submitting, is to leave those questions till the last and answer all the other questions first. Then turn on those services and submit those remaining questions so that you are able to get the full marks for the GA.\nPlease remember that your last save will be your official score. So make sure that the last save in the part where you reload is your best score.\nGod bless,\nCarlton D’Silva",

      "@s.anand\n@carlton\nSir i am done with my api endpoint for project 1 but i did one change in the given test file where we have to edit our api endpoint and test it as mentioned in the project description. I was testing my model but was getting the same response every time even though my model was giving the expected answer to those question when tested separately. I found that in the test file (promptfoo.yaml) the cache is marked as true and because of which whenever i try to run the test file it does not hit my api endpoint and take the old response from the cache. So i changed the cache to false and tried running that test file and got the results as shown below in the image.\nimage\n1861×912 105 KB\nIn this as you can see for the 2nd test case since i am using the openai model to give the final answer so it is using my context and saying that dashboard will show 11/10, but the expected answer should contain “110”. The problem i am facing is as you can see the url given in my response is same as expected which means my model is picking the right context to answer the question but since i am using openai to make my final answer using this context it is very unlikely that it will say that dashboard will show “110” because this doesn’t make sense. So can you please help me how should i tackle this ? As this is the only test case left.\nAnd also i have added one prompt field in the test file because i was getting warning regarding this missing field again and again. So is it okay ?",
