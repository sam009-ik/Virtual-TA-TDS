It replaces tools like pip, conda, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, and virtualenv into one, enabling:\nPython Version Management: uv installs and manages multiple Python versions, allowing developers to specify and switch between versions seamlessly.\nVirtual Environment Handling: It automates the creation and management of virtual environments, ensuring isolated and consistent development spaces for different projects.\nDependency Management: With support for the pyproject.toml format, uv enables precise specification of project dependencies. It maintains a universal lockfile, uv.lock, to ensure reproducible installations across different systems.\nProject Execution: The uv run command allows for the execution of scripts and applications within the managed environment, streamlining development workflows.\nHere are some commonly used commands:\n# Replace python with uv. This automatically installs Python and dependencies.\nuv run script.py\n\n# Run a Python script directly from the Internet\nuv run https://example.com/script.py\n\n# Run a Python script without installing\nuvx ruff\n\n# Use a specific Python version\nuv run --python 3.11 script.py\n\n# Add dependencies to your script\nuv add httpx --script script.py\n\n# Create a virtual environment at .venv\nuv venv\n\n# Install packages to your virtual environment\nuv pip install httpx\nCopy to clipboard\nHere are some useful tools you can run with uvx without installation:\nuvx --from jupyterlab jupyter-lab   # Jupyter notebook\nuvx marimo      # Interactive notebook\nuvx llm         # Chat with LLMs from the command line\nuvx openwebui   # Chat with LLMs via the browser\nuvx httpie      # Make HTTP requests\nuvx datasette   # Browse SQLite databases\nuvx markitdown  # Convert PDF to Markdown\nuvx yt-dlp      # Download YouTube videos\nuvx asciinema   # Record your terminal and play it\nuv uses inline script metadata for dependencies. The eliminates the need for requirements.txt or virtual environments.

It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.\nLearn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.\nSome programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:\nCharacter Encodings: Different ways to represent text in computers\nASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only\nUTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII\nUTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java\nUTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple\nCommon encoding issues you’ll encounter:\n# Reading files with explicit encoding\nwith open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Handling encoding errors\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n\n# Detecting file encoding\nimport chardet\nwith open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:\n    result = chardet.detect(f.read())\nprint(result['encoding'])\nPrevious\nJavaScript tools: npx\nNext\nBrowser: DevTools"

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.\nHere are things you should know when you’re compressing images:\nImage dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot\nLossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\nLossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\nVector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\nWebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\nHere’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\nUse SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\nElse, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\nCommon operations with Python:\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\nasync def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\n        if img.mode == 'RGBA':\n            img = img.convert('RGB')\n        # Optimize for web\n        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)\n\n# Batch process images\npaths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')\nfor p in paths:\n    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))\nCommand line tools include cwebp, pngquant, jpegoptim, and ImageMagick.\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp\n\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant --quality=65-80 image.png\n\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg\n\n# Convert and resize\nconvert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg\n\n# Batch convert\nmogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg\nWatch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):\nTools for image optimization:\nsquoosh.app: Browser-based compression\nImageOptim: GUI tool for Mac\nsharp: Node.js image processing\nPillow: Python imaging library\nPrevious\nMarkdown\nNext\nStatic hosting: GitHub Pages"

Data Visualization\nServerless hosting: Vercel\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses:\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\nYou can’t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt\nYou can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\nYou can’t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run())\nVercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\nHere’s a quickstart. Sign-up with Vercel. Create an empty git repo with this api/index.py file.\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a requirements.txt file with fastapi as a dependency.\nfastapi\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. main.py.\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}\nAdd a vercel.json file to the root of your repository.\n{\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],\n  \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }]\n}\nOn the command line, run:\nnpx vercel to deploy a test version\nnpx vercel --prod to deploy to production\nEnvironment Variables. Use npx vercel env add to add environment variables. In your code, use os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') to access them.\nVideos\nPrevious\nNotebooks: Google Colab\nNext\nCI/CD: GitHub Actions"

Data Visualization\nContainers: Docker, Podman\nDocker and Podman are containerization tools that package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development and deployment.\nDocker is the industry standard. Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way.\nInitialize the container engine:\npodman machine init\npodman machine start\nCommon Operations. (You can use docker instead of podman in the same way.)\n# Pull an image\npodman pull python:3.11-slim\n\n# Run a container\npodman run -it python:3.11-slim\n\n# List containers\npodman ps -a\n\n# Stop container\npodman stop container_id\n\n# Scan image for vulnerabilities\npodman scan myapp:latest\n\n# Remove container\npodman rm container_id\n\n# Remove all stopped containers\npodman container prune\nCopy to clipboard\nYou can create a Dockerfile to build a container image. Here’s a sample Dockerfile that converts a Python script into a container image.\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n# Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine,\n# but here we're just using a simple script.\nRUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py\n# Run the script\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\nTo build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:\n# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login\npodman login docker.io\n\n# Build and run the container\npodman build -t py-hello .\npodman run -it py-hello\n\n# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.\npodman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello\n\n# Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev\nTAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG\nTools:\nDive: Explore image layers\nSkopeo: Work with container images\nTrivy: Security scanner\nOptional: For Windows, see WSL 2 with Docker getting started\nPrevious\nCI/CD: GitHub Actions\nNext\nDevContainers: GitHub Codespaces"

It’s essential for testing webhooks, sharing work in progress, or debugging applications in production-like environments.\nRun the command uvx ngrok http 8000 to create a tunnel to your local server on port 8000. This generates a public URL that you can share with others.\nTo get started, log into ngrok.com and get an authtoken from the dashboard. Copy it. Then run:\nngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_AUTHTOKEN\nNow you can forward any local port to the internet. For example:\n# Start a local server on port 8000\nuv run -m http.server 8000\n\n# Start HTTP tunnel\nuvx ngrok http 8000\nHere are useful things you can do with ngrok http:\nngrok http file://. to serve local files\n--response-header-add \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\" to enable CORS\n--oauth google --oauth-client-id $CLIENT_ID --oauth-client-secret $SECRET --oauth-allow-domain example.com --oauth-allow-email user@example.org to restrict users to @example.com and user@example.org using Google Auth\n--ua-filter-deny \".*bot$\" to reject user agents ending with bot\nPrevious\nDevContainers: GitHub Codespaces\nNext\nCORS"

Data Visualization\nCORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.\nWatch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):\nKey CORS concepts:\nSame-Origin Policy: Browsers block requests between different origins by default\nCORS Headers: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests\nPreflight Requests: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed\nCredentials: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication\nIf you’re exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *.\nHere are other common CORS headers:\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nTo implement CORS in FastAPI, use the CORSMiddleware middleware:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\napp.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins\n# Or, provide more granular control:\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"],  # Allow a specific domain\n    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies\n    allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"],  # Allow specific methods\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],  # Allow all headers\n)\nTesting CORS with JavaScript:\n// Simple request\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  method: \"GET\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n\n// Request with credentials\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\nUseful CORS debugging tools:\nCORS Checker: Test CORS configurations\nBrowser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests\ncors-anywhere: CORS proxy for development\nCommon CORS errors and solutions:\nNo 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header: Configure server to send proper CORS headers\nRequest header field not allowed: Add required headers to Access-Control-Allow-Headers\nCredentials flag: Set both credentials: 'include' and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nWild card error: Cannot use * with credentials; specify exact origins\nPrevious\nTunneling: ngrok\nNext\nREST APIs"

But in short:\nReplace OPENAI_BASE_URL, i.e. https://api.openai.com/v1 with https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1... or https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...\nReplace OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPIPE_TOKEN\nReplace model names, e.g. gpt-4.1-nano, with openai/gpt-4.1-nano\nFor example, let’s use Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenRouter for chat completions and Text Embedding 3 Small via OpenAI for embeddings:\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'\nCopy to clipboard\nOr using llm:\nllm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1\nllm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small\nFor a 50% discount (but slower speed), use Flex processing by adding service_tier: \"flex\" to your JSON request.\nAI Proxy - Jan 2025\nFor the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an iitm.ac.in email to use gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small. Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don’t exceed that.\nUse AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically:\nReplace your API to https://api.openai.com/... with https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...\nReplace the OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPROXY_TOKEN that someone will give you.\nPrevious\nLocal LLMs: Ollama\nNext\nPrompt engineering"

Data Sourcing\n5. Data Preparation\n6. Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nPrompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\nAnthropic\nGoogle\nOpenAI\nHere are some best practices:\nUse prompt optimizers\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\nAnthropic Prompt Optimizer\nOpenAI Prompt Generation\nGoogle AI-powered prompt writing tools\nBe clear, direct, and detailed\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\nBAD: Explain gravitation lensing. (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\nGOOD: Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\nWhen you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. For example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nGive examples\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\nBAD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\nGOOD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:\nTo tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…\nTo tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…\nNow, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\nGive examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nThink step by step\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\nBAD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\nGOOD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\nAsk the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nAssign a role\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\nBAD: Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\nGOOD: You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\nTell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nUse XML to structure your prompt\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\nBAD: Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\nGOOD:\n<instructions>\n  Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n</instructions>\n<example>\n  Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n</example>\n(Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\nThink of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\nUse Markdown to format your output\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\nBAD: Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\nGOOD: Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nBAD: Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\nGOOD: Correct the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>. (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nMarkdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\nUse JSON for machine-readable output\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\nBAD: Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\nGOOD:\nOrganize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n]\n```\n(Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\nNote: Always use JSON schema if possible. JSON schema is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\nImagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\nPrefer Yes/No answers\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\nBAD: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\nGOOD: Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\nDon’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers. They don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\nAsk for reason first, then the answer\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\nBAD: What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\nGOOD: First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\nBEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. That way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\nUse proper spelling and grammar\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\nBAD: xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser?? (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\nGOOD: Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation. (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\nIf your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. When you do, the response will be much clearer.\nVideo Tutorials\nWatch Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min).

Data Sourcing\n5. Data Preparation\n6. Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nBase 64 Encoding\nBase64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\nHere’s how it works:\nIt takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n… using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4)\nThere’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs\nBase64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\nFor example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\nBase64 is used in many places:\nJSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\nEmail: MIME attachments encoding\nAuth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\nJWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\nSSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\nSAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\nGit: Encoding binary files in patches\nTools for working with Base64:\nBase64 Decoder/Encoder for online encoding/decoding\ndata: URI Generator converts files to Data URIs\nPrevious\nLLM Text Extraction\nNext\nVision Models"

Data Sourcing\n5. Data Preparation\n6. Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nEmbeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\nSearch. Find similar documents to a query.\nClassification. Classify text into categories.\nClustering. Group similar items into clusters.\nAnomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text.\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\nFeature Local Models API\nPrivacy High Dependent on provider\nCost High setup, low after that Pay-as-you-go\nScale Limited by local resources Easily scales with demand\nQuality Varies by model Typically high\nThe Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\nRank. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\nMemory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\nEmbedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\nMax Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input.\nLook for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\nLocal Embeddings\nHere’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())\nNote the get_similarity function. It uses a Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\nOpenAI Embeddings\nFor comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the embed function in the earlier script:\nimport os\nimport httpx\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.post(\n            \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\",\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"},\n            json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text}\n        )\n        return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]\nNOTE: You need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable for this to work.\nPrevious\nVision Models\nNext\nMultimodal Embeddings"

Data Visualization\nVector Databases\nVector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently.\nUse vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON’T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.)\nVector databases are an evolving space.\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\nchroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025\nqdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025\nlancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025\nfaiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025\nmilvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025\nweaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:\nDuckDB: Supports vector search with vss.\nSQLite: Supports vector search with sqlite-vec.\nPostgreSQL: Supports vector search with pgvector.\nTake a look at this Vector DB Comparison.\nWatch this Vector Database Tutorial (3 min):\nChromaDB\nHere’s a minimal example using Chroma:\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"chromadb\",\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nimport chromadb\nfrom chromadb.utils import embedding_functions\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nasync def setup_vector_db():\n    \"\"\"Initialize Chroma DB with an embedding function.\"\"\"\n    sentence_transformer_ef = embedding_functions.SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction(\n        model_name=\"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\"\n    )\n    client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=\"./vector_db\")\n    collection = client.create_collection(\n        name=\"documents\",\n        embedding_function=sentence_transformer_ef\n    )\n    return collection\n\nasync def search_similar(collection, query: str, n_results: int = 3) -> list[dict]:\n    \"\"\"Search for documents similar to the query.\"\"\"\n    d = collection.query(query_texts=[query], n_results=n_results)\n    return [\n        {\"id\": id, \"text\": text, \"distance\": distance}\n        for id, text, distance in zip(d[\"ids\"][0], d[\"documents\"][0], d[\"distances\"][0])\n    ]\n\nasync def main():\n    collection = await setup_vector_db()\n\n    #

Data Visualization\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n# Answer: fat arrow\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n# Answer: node.getChildren()\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\"\n# Answer: trivia\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n# Answer: !!\nCopy to clipboard\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.\n1. Clone the repository\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book\ncd typescript-book\n--depth 1 fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.\ncd typescript-book moves into the project folder.\nYou’ll now be in a new folder typescript-book containing the repo.\n2. Split Markdown files into chunks\n(\n  shopt -s globstar\n  for f in **/*.md; do\n    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\\n    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\\n    | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '\n      split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]\n      | to_entries\n      | map({\n          id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),\n          content: .value\n        })[]\n    '\n  done\n) | tee chunks.json\nshopt -s globstar: lets **/*.md match Markdown files in all subdirectories. bash shopt manual\nuvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt: a tool that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks:\n--model gpt-4o: uses GPT‑4o token limits\n--limit 4096: max tokens per chunk\n--separator \"===SPLIT===\": custom split marker\nsed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/': ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)\njq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\": uses jq to convert chunks to JSON\n-R: read raw input\n-s: slurp entire input into a single string\n-c: compact JSON output\nbuilds an array of objects {id, content}, where id is filename#chunkIndex\ntee chunks.json: writes the resulting JSON array to chunks.json while printing it to stdout.\nYou’ll now have a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line.\n3. Generate embeddings\nllm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json\nembed-multi: computes embeddings for each entry in chunks.json.\ntypescript-book: a namespace or collection name for storage.\n--model 3-small: selects the embedding model.\n--store: save embeddings in the default backend.\n--format nl: input is newline‑delimited JSON. llm CLI embed-multi\nThis stores the embeddings in a collection called typescript-book.\nllm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored\nllm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection\n4. Find similar topics\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\nThis returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.\nsimilar: retrieves the top n most similar chunks from the embeddings store.\n-n 3: return three results.\n-c: the user’s query string.\n5.

Data Visualization\nHybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense\nHybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.\nBelow is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line.\nInstall and run TypeSense\nInstall TypeSense.\nmkdir typesense-data\n\ndocker run -p 8108:8108 \\\n  -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\\n  --data-dir /data \\\n  --api-key=secret-key \\\n  --enable-cors\nCopy to clipboard\ndocker run: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108\n-p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port.\n-v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence.\n--data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume.\n--api-key=secret-key secures your API.\n--enable-cors allows browser-based requests.\nExpected output:\nDocker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as Started Typesense API server.\nListening on http://0.0.0.0:8108.\nEmbed and import documents into TypeSense\nFollow the steps in the RAG with the CLI tutorial to create a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line.\nTypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents. We’ll use that capability.\nSave the following as addnotes.py and run it with uv run addnotes.py.\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\"httpx\"]\n# ///\nimport json\nimport httpx\nimport os\n\nheaders = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"}\n\nschema = {\n    \"name\": \"notes\",\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\n            \"name\": \"embedding\",\n            \"type\": \"float[]\",\n            \"embed\": {\n                \"from\": [\"content\"],\n                \"model_config\": {\n                    \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\",\n                    \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n}\n\nwith open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    # Create the collection\n    if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404:\n        r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers)\n\n    # Embed the chunks\n    result = client.post(\n        \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\",\n        headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"},\n        data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),\n    )\n    print(result.text)\nhttpx.Client: an HTTP client for Python.\nCollection schema: id and content fields plus an embedding field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI.\nAuto-embedding: the embed block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document.\nGET /collections/notes: checks existence.\nPOST /collections: creates the collection.\nPOST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.\nExpected output:\nA JSON summary string like {\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0} indicating how many docs were imported.\n(On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)\n4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question\nNow, we can use a single curl against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a hybrid search:\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n\npayload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\\n  '{\n     searches: [\n       {\n         collection: $coll,\n         q:           $q,\n         query_by:    \"content,embedding\",\n         sort_by:     \"_text_match:desc\",\n         prefix:      false,\n         exclude_fields: \"embedding\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }'\n)\ncurl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\\n  -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\\n  -d \"$payload\" \\\n  | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes.

This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems.\nOpenAI supports Function Calling – a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how.\nHere’s a minimal example using Python and OpenAI’s function calling that identifies the weather in a given location.\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"httpx\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nimport httpx\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n\ndef query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    response = httpx.post(\n        \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\",\n        headers={\n            \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        },\n        json={\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n            \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}],\n            \"tools\": tools,\n            \"tool_choice\": \"auto\",\n        },\n    )\n    return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"]\n\n\nWEATHER_TOOL = {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            \"additionalProperties\": False,\n        },\n        \"strict\": True,\n    },\n}\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL])\n    print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]])\nHow to define functions\nThe function definition is a JSON schema with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the Supported schemas.\nHere’s an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting:\nMEETING_TOOL = {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\",\n        \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"date\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\"\n                },\n                \"time\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\"\n                },\n                \"meeting_room\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"],\n            \"additionalProperties\": False\n        },\n        \"strict\": True\n    }\n}\nHow to define multiple functions\nYou can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the tools parameter.\nHere’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\",\n            \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"employee_id\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"employee_id\"],\n                \"additionalProperties\": False\n            },\n            \"strict\": True\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\",\n            \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"employee_id\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"\n                    },\n                    \"current_year\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"],\n                \"additionalProperties\": False\n            },\n            \"strict\": True\n        }\n    }\n]\nBest Practices:\nUse Strict Mode\nAlways set strict: True to ensure valid function calls\nDefine all required parameters\nSet additionalProperties: False\nUse tool choice\nSet tool_choice: \"required\" to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools\nThe default is tool_choice: \"auto\" which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate\nClear Descriptions\nWrite detailed function and parameter descriptions\nInclude expected formats and units\nMention any constraints or limitations\nError Handling\nValidate function inputs before execution\nReturn clear error messages\nHandle missing or invalid parameters\nPrevious\nHybrid RAG with TypeSense\nNext\nLLM Agents"

Data Visualization\nLLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act\nLLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\nWhat Makes an Agent?\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\nLLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next\nTools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\nMemory: Retains context across multiple steps\nAgents operate through a loop:\nObserve the environment\nThink about what to do\nTake action using tools\nObserve results\nRepeat until task completion\nCommand-Line Agent Example\nWe’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that:\nTakes a task description from the command line\nGenerates code to accomplish the task\nAutomatically extracts and executes the code\nPasses the results back to the LLM\nProvides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\nHere’s how it works:\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\nThe agent will:\nGenerate a shell script to list files with their sizes\nExecute the script in a subprocess\nCapture the output (stdout and stderr)\nPass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\nPresent a final answer to the user\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\nInitial prompt to generate a shell script\nCode extraction from the LLM response\nCode execution in a subprocess\nResult interpretation by the LLM\nError handling and retry logic if needed\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\nPlanning (generating code)\nExecution (running the code)\nReflection (interpreting results)\nAdaptation (fixing errors if needed)\nAgent Architectures\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\nReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\nReflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\nMRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\nPlan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\nReal-World Applications\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\nResearch assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information\nCoding assistants that write, debug, and explain code\nData analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data\nCustomer service agents that handle queries and perform actions\nPersonal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks\nProject Ideas\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\nStudy buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\nJob application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\nPersonal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\nHealth and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\nCourse project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\nBest Practices\nClear instructions: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations\nEffective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable\nRobust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\nMemory management: Balance context retention with token efficiency\nUser feedback: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\nLimitations and Challenges\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\nHallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\nPlanning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\nTool integration complexity: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\nContext window constraints: Limited memory for long-running tasks\nSecurity concerns: Tool access requires careful permission management\nPrevious\nFunction Calling\nNext\nLLM Image Generation"

Data Visualization\nProject: TDS Virtual TA\nCreate a virtual Teaching Assistant Discourse responder.\nBackground\nYou are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras’ Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course.\nOut of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:\nCourse content with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.\nTDS Discourse posts with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.\nScrape the data\nTo make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.\nCreate an API\nYour application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at https://app.example.com/api/.\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.\nFor example, here’s how anyone can make a request:\ncurl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"\nThis is a real question and uses this screenshot:\nThe response must be a JSON object like this:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question.\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\",\n      \"text\": \"Use the model that’s mentioned in the question.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\",\n      \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nEvaluate your application\nHere are a few sample questions and evaluation parameters. These are indicative. The actual evaluation could ask any realistic student question.\nTo run this:\nEdit project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml to replace providers[0].config.url with your API URL.\nRun this script:\nnpx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml\nDeploy your application\nDeploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform.\n(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)\nShare your code\nCreate a new public GitHub repository\nAdd an MIT LICENSE file\nCommit and push your code\nSubmit your URL\nSubmit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-project-virtual-ta #TODO\nEvaluation\nPre-requisites: Your repository MUST meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\nYour GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\nYour GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license in the root folder\nWe will use a modified version of project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml with 10 realistic questions. Correct answers will be awarded up to 2 marks each.\nYour score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get.\nBonus:\n1 mark if your GitHub repo includes a script that scrapes the Discourse posts across a date range from a Discourse course page like TDS\n2 marks if we deploy your solution (with minimal modifications) as an official solution for students to use.\nPrevious\nLLM Evals\nNext\n4.

Data Preparation\n6. Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nData Sourcing\nBefore you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it. And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data.\nThere are three ways you can get the data.\nThe first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data.\nThe second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\nThe third way is you have to scrape it. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\nHere are links used in the video:\nThe Movies Dataset\nIMDb Datasets\nDownload the IMDb Datasets\nExplore the Internet Movie Database\nWhat does the world search for?\nHowStat - Cricket statistics\nCricket Strike Rates\nPrevious\nProject 1\nNext\nScraping with Excel"

Data Preparation\n6. Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nCrawling with the CLI\nSince websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline.\nWeb crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios:\nData mining and analysis: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research\nContent archiving: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes\nSEO analysis: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings\nLegal compliance: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation\nWebsite migration: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design\nOffline access: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection\nThe most commonly used tool for fetching websites is wget. It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.\nTo crawl the IIT Madras Data Science Program website for example, you could run:\nwget \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\nHere’s what each option does:\n--recursive: Enables recursive downloading (following links)\n--level=3: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL\n--no-parent: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory\n--convert-links: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally\n--adjust-extension: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types\n--compression=auto: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate)\n--accept html,htm: Only downloads files with these extensions\n--directory-prefix=./ds: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory\nwget2 is a better version of wget and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same.\nwget2 \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\nThere are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget:\nWpull\nWpull is a wget‐compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration.\nuvx wpull \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\nHTTrack\nHTTrack is dedicated website‐mirroring tool with rich filtering and link‐conversion options.\nhttrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\\n  -O \"./ds\" \\\n  \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\\n  -r3\nRobots.txt\nrobots.txt is a standard file found in a website’s root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It’s part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.\nWhy it’s important:\nServer load protection: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers\nPrivacy protection: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed\nLegal compliance: Respects website owners’ rights to control access to their content\nEthical web citizenship: Shows respect for website administrators’ wishes\nHow to override robots.txt restrictions:\nwget, wget2: Use -e robots=off\nhttrack: Use -s0\nwpull: Use --no-robots\nWhen to override robots.txt (use with discretion):\nOnly bypass robots.txt when:\nYou have explicit permission from the website owner\nYou’re crawling your own website\nThe content is publicly accessible and your crawling won’t cause server issues\nYou’re conducting authorized security testing\nRemember that bypassing robots.txt without legitimate reason may:\nViolate terms of service\nLead to IP banning\nResult in legal consequences in some jurisdictions\nCause reputation damage to your organization\nAlways use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.\nPrevious\nScraping with Google Sheets\nNext\nBBC Weather API with Python"

Data Visualization\nConverting PDFs to Markdown\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nUse Cases:\nLLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\nKnowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\nContent repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\nData extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\nAccessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\nCitation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\nDocumentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\nPyMuPDF4LLM\nPyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\nPYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\nuv run --with pymupdf4llm: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\npython -c '...': Executes Python code directly from the command line\nimport pymupdf4llm: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\nh = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"): Creates a file to write the markdown output\nh.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")): Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\nMarkitdown\nMarkitdown is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md\nPYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\nuvx markitdown: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n$FILE.pdf: The input PDF file\n> markitdown.md: Redirects output to a markdown file\nUnstructured\nUnstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\nGROBID\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml\nMistral OCR API\nMistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\nAzure Document Intelligence API\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.\nOther libraries\nDocling is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\nMegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\nComparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\nTool Strengths Weaknesses Best For\nPyMuPDF4LLM Structure preservation, LLM optimization Requires PyTorch AI training data, semantic structure\nMarkitdown Multi-format support, simple usage Less precise layout handling Batch processing, mixed documents\nUnstructured Wide format support, active development Can be resource-intensive Production pipelines, integration\nGROBID Reference extraction excellence Narrower use case Academic papers, citations\nDocling Advanced document understanding Installation difficulties Research applications\nMegaParse Comprehensive approach Requires OpenAI API Complex documents, OCR needs\nHow to pick:\nNeed LLM-ready content? PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\nWorking with multiple document formats? Markitdown handles diverse inputs\nExtracting academic references? GROBID remains the standard\nBuilding a production pipeline? Unstructured offers the best integration options\nHandling complex layouts? Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\nTips for Optimal PDF Conversion\nPre-process PDFs when possible:\n# Optimize a PDF for text extraction first\nocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdf\nTry multiple tools on the same document to compare results:\nHandle scanned PDFs appropriately:\n# For scanned documents, run OCR first\nocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf > markitdown.md\nConsider post-processing for better results:\n# Simple post-processing example\nsed -i 's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g' output.md  # Add line breaks after sentences\nPrevious\nScraping PDFs with Tabula\nNext\nConvert HTML to Markdown"

Data Visualization\nConverting HTML to Markdown\nWhen working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:\nContent analysis: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\nData mining: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\nOffline reading: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\nContent migration: Move content between different CMS platforms\nSEO analysis: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\nArchive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\nAccessibility: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line.\ndefuddle-cli\ndefuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;\nfind . -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found\nnpx --package defuddle-cli -y: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\ndefuddle parse {} --md: Parses the HTML file (represented by {}) and converts to markdown\n-o {}.md: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\nPandoc\nPandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;\nfind . -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found\npandoc: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n-f html -t markdown_strict: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n-o {}.md {}: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\nLynx\nLynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +\nfind . -type f -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\nfor f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch\nlynx -dump -nolist \"$f\": Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n-dump: Output the rendered page to stdout\n-nolist: Don’t include the list of links at the end\n> \"${f%.html}.txt\": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\nw3m\nw3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' \\\n  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ {} +\nfind . -type f -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\nfor f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch\nw3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\": Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML\n-dump: Output the rendered page to stdout\n-T text/html: Specify input format as HTML\n-cols 80: Set output width to 80 columns\n-no-graph: Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames\n> \"${f%.html}.md\": Save output to a .md file with the same base name\nComparison\nApproach Speed Format Quality Preservation Best For\ndefuddle-cli Slow High Good structure and links Content migration, publishing\npandoc Slow Very High Almost everything Academic papers, documentation\nlynx Fast Low Basic structure only Quick extraction, large batches\nw3m Very Slow Medium-Low Basic structure with better tables Improved readability over lynx\nOptimize Batch Processing\nProcess in parallel: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:\nfind . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"\nFilter files before processing:\nfind . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;\nCustomize output format with additional parameters:\n# For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting\nfind . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;\nHandle errors gracefully:\nfind . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +\nChoosing the Right Tool\nNeed speed with minimal formatting? Use the lynx approach\nNeed precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc\nNeed a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli\nWorking with complex tables? w3m might render them better\nRemember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.\nCombined Crawling and Conversion\nSometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler.\nFor research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion\nFor simple website archiving: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution\nFor high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion\nFor maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline\nCrawl4AI\nCrawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation.

(playwright.dev)\nHeadless & headed modes: Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. (playwright.dev)\nAuto‑waiting & retry: Built‑in locators reduce flakiness. (playwright.dev)\nMulti‑browser support: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit—all from one API. (playwright.dev)\nExample: Scraping a JS‑Rendered Site\nWe’ll scrape Quotes to Scrape (JS)—a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple requests call gets only an empty shell (quotes.toscrape.com). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content:\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\"playwright\"]\n# ///\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\ndef scrape_quotes():\n    with sync_playwright() as p:\n        # Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\".\n        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True, channel=\"chrome\")\n        page = browser.new_page()\n        page.goto(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/\")\n        quotes = page.query_selector_all(\".quote\")\n        for q in quotes:\n            text = q.query_selector(\".text\").inner_text()\n            author = q.query_selector(\".author\").inner_text()\n            print(f\"{text} — {author}\")\n        browser.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    scrape_quotes()\nSave as scraper.py and run:\nuv run scraper.py\nYou’ll see each quote plus author printed—fetched only after the JS executes.\nPrevious\nLLM Video Screen-Scraping\nNext\nScheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions"

Data Preparation\n6. Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nScheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions\nGitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.\nKey Concepts\nScheduling: Use cron syntax to run scrapers at specific times\nDependencies: Install required packages like httpx, lxml\nData Storage: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing\nRate Limiting: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests\nHere’s a sample scrape.py that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:\nimport json\nimport httpx\nfrom datetime import datetime, UTC\nfrom lxml import html\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\n\ndef scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"}\n    response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    tree = html.fromstring(response.text)\n    movies = []\n\n    for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"):\n        title = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")\n            else None\n        )\n        year = (\n            item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")\n            else None\n        )\n        rating = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")\n            else None\n        )\n\n        if title and year and rating:\n            movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating})\n\n    return movies\n\n\n# Scrape data and save with timestamp\nnow = datetime.now(UTC)\nwith open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f:\n    f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\")\nCopy to clipboard\nHere’s a sample .github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml that runs the scraper daily and saves the data:\nname: Scrape IMDb Top 250\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day\n    - cron: \"0 0 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  scrape-imdb:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Install uv\n        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5\n\n      - name: Run scraper\n        run: | # python\n          uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py\n\n      - name: Commit and push changes\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add *.json\n          git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0\n          git push\nBest Practices\nCache Dependencies: Use GitHub’s caching to speed up package installation\nHandle Errors: Implement retries and error logging\nRate Limiting: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers\nData Validation: Verify scraped data structure before saving\nMonitoring: Set up notifications for workflow failures\nTools and Resources\nhttpx: Async HTTP client\nGitHub Actions Marketplace\nGitHub Actions Documentation\nVideo Tutorials\nPrevious\nWeb Automation with Playwright\nNext\nScraping emarketer.com"

Data Analysis\nProject 2\n7. Data Visualization\nParsing JSON\nJSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\nFor example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\nTool Extract from JSON… Why\njq JSON in the shell Quick data exploration and pipeline processing\nJMESPath JSON in Python Handle complex queries with a clean syntax\nijson JSON streams in Python Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently\nPandas JSON columns in Python Fast analysis of structured data\nSQL JSON JSON in databases Combine structured and semi-structured data\nDuckDB JSON anywhere Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory\nExamples:\nUse Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\nLeverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\nApply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\nPractice with these resources:\nJSONPath Online Evaluator: Test JSON queries\njq play: Interactive jq query testing\nDuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\nCommand-line JSON Processing with jq\njq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\nExample: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\nJMESPath Queries\nJMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\nExample: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)\nStreaming with ijson\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\nExample: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return results\nPandas JSON Columns\nPandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\nExample: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\nSQL JSON Functions\nSQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\nExample: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\nDuckDB JSON Processing\nDuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\nExample: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100\nPrevious\nProfiling Data with Python\nNext\nData Transformation with dbt"

Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\nThey can handle audio input.\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\nTranscribe into other languages. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\nSummarize audio transcripts.

It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.\nMarimo’s cells can’t be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.\nIt also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. Browse the gallery of examples. With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It’s growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.\nCommon Operations:\n# Create new notebook\nuvx marimo new\n\n# Run notebook server\nuvx marimo edit notebook.py\n\n# Export to HTML\nuvx marimo export notebook.py\nCopy to clipboard\nBest Practices:\nCell Dependencies\nKeep cells focused and atomic\nUse clear variable names\nDocument data flow between cells\nInteractive Elements\n# Add interactive widgets\nslider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)\n# Create dynamic Markdown\nmo.md(f\"{slider} {\"🟢\" * slider.value}\")\nVersion Control\nKeep notebooks are Python files\nUse Git to track changes\nPublish on marimo.app for collaboration\nPrevious\nNarratives with LLMs\nNext\nHTML Slides: RevealJS"
